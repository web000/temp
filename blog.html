    <p>Planes emitting carbon emissions, hotels using gallons of water to launder sheets and towels, thirsty travelers drinking big quantities of water from plastic bottles – traveling is one of the easiest ways to pollute the planet and leave a big footprint. What do you do if you want to travel but hate to leave such a mark on the planet? The good news is that there is something you can do. Many Eco-travel friendly practices can be used to lower your footprint while you are still able to enjoy the wonders of the world.

* While eco-friendliness might have many meanings ascribed to it, what we mean by it in this post is travel that is sustainable and with minimal negative impact on our planet.

Before we introduce you to the 13 best Eco-friendly travel bloggers, we would love to offer you a piece of advice ourselves. Every change begins with a small step, which in this case is how you choose to pack your suitcase. Check out our checklist for packing a “green” luggage.</p>

    <p>I’d say invest your time in making your home as energy efficient as possible. Insulate where you can, particularly your loft, taking advantage of the free insulation schemes currently on offer. Block up any draughts. Line your curtains. Anything that keeps the heat in and the cold out basically, and you’ll use significantly less energy to heat your home, thereby cutting your fossil fuel usage and saving you a considerable sum of money.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://ethicalunicorn.com/">Blog Title Number three</a></h1>
    <p>Take it one step at a time. When you want to change it can easy to feel paralysed by all the things you need to alter, but throwing away everything and trying to start over all at once often isn’t the most helpful way to go. Instead start small and simple. What do you use the most that can be replaced with a more sustainable alternative? What small changes can you begin to implement? And build from there until, over time, you’re living the green dream.</p>

      <p>Micro beads are in a surprising amount of products, and they are awful for our environment. They get washed down the drain, end up in our oceans and in our ecosystem. Avoid using body washes, toothpaste, facial watches and house hold products with micro beads and opt for more natural products. Buying from natural and independent brands are better for your health, our environment and your local economy.</p>
